htmlbase v4
===========

The lightweight css framework.

About this framework in a few words:
* Based on some parts of the Twitter Bootstap
* Includes only commonly used styles
* Uses LESS to be highly customizable (see `/style.example.less`)
* Provides a lot of useful mixins (e.g. `.border-radius()`)
* All class names in the framework are namespaced by `hb-` to avoid collisions with your own class names
* Includes own reset.css based on other implementations
